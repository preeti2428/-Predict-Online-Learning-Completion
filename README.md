This project aims to predict whether a student will complete an online course based on their engagement data, including the number of videos watched, assignments submitted, and forum posts. Using a supervised machine learning approach, specifically a Random Forest Classifier, the model analyzes these features to classify students as likely to complete or not complete the course. The dataset is preprocessed using feature scaling, and model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix. The goal is to help educators identify at-risk students early and improve course completion rates through data-driven insights.
